// What do we need for a WAR card game?

/**
 * Deck
 *  -52 cards (should each card be its own class? Should it be an object with 
 *   3 values?)
 *  -Rank ("name value")
 *  -Suit (hert/spade,club,diamond)
 *   -Values
 * -a way to shuffle
 * -a way to pass the cards to the players (should this be in my deck? or my 
 *    game logic?)
 * 
 * Players (do I need a player class? or can I just put in my game logic?)
 * -Name
 * Score
 * Hand
 * 
 * Logic to actually play the game.. we can use a deck in any card game,
 * but we're playing a specific one.
 * ways to compare the cards... number values on each card
 *
